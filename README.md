# Projet-Python---Seoul-Bike-Location
### Authors : **Nicolas CARVAL** and **Alexandre BORDAS**

Here is our work for the dataset named "Seoul Bike Sharing Demand".

In this repository you will find :

- A **PDF** report (SeoulBikeRent.pdf), explaining all the in and outs of the project
- A **Jupiter Notebook** (Project.ipng), containing all our work on the dataset (Analysis and Machine Learning)
- A **HTML** file (HTML_Notebook.html), corresponding to the Notebook but in html in order to ease the viewing of every graphs
- A **Python** file (app.py), corresponding to our API, allowing us to make predictions, it is related to the template and static directories, containing .html and .css for interface.
- A **Pickle** file (model.pkl), which stores our Machine learning model created.

### Context:
This dataset contains count of public bikes rented at each hour in Seoul Bike sharing System with the corresponding Weather data and Holidays information.

Currently Rental bikes are introduced in many urban cities for the enhancement of mobility comfort. It is important to make the rental bike available and accessible to the public at the right time as it lessens the waiting time. Eventually, providing the city with a stable supply of rental bikes becomes a major concern. The crucial part is the prediction of bike count required at each hour for the stable supply of rental bikes.

Thus we will explore this dataset in order to show the link between the number of bikes rented and the other variables present in the dataset. We will then elaborate a machine learning model in order to provide a way to predict more or less the number ok bikes that could be rented under specific conditions.
